Coursera's Getting and Cleaning Data Week 4 Final Project

## Description
This project, the final project for Coursera's Getting and Cleaning Data course, uses data collected from the accelerometer and gyroscope of the Samsung Galaxy S smartphone. I  retrieved, merged and cleaned the data files to prepare a tidy dataset that can be used for later analysis. I used R Version 3.4.2 (Short Summer) for this analysis.

## Data

## Directions
The instructions for the project:

You should create one R script called run_analysis.R that does the following.

- Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
- Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
- Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
- Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names.
- From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject. 

## Documents
The scripts to complete the project, the resulting datasets and the codebook can all be found in the main project Github repo, here: https://github.com/KatDevlin/CleaningDataFinalProject
